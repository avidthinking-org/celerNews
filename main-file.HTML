            <h3><b>Breaking News | Violence Erupts In Bihar's Ara During Bharat
               Bandh; Gunfire Reported - YouTube</b>
            </h3>
            <p>Reports from Bihar showed attempts to block trains, while some
               schools suspended their bus services in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, which
               was the worst hit during the April 2 nationwide bandh called by Dalit
               groups with at least eight people being killed in violent protests.
               Officials in MP said the call for today's bandh was given on social
               media and no organisation had come forward so far to claim
               responsibility for it. In Rajasthan, which was also hit badly during
               the Dalit-convened bandh, the state government has issued prohibitory
               orders under the Section 144 of the CrPC and blocked mobile internet
               services in the state capital as precautionary measure. Yesterday, the
               union Home Ministry had issued advisory to all states to beef up
               security and prevent violence during the Bharat Bandh against
               caste-based reservations in jobs and education. In Gujarat, which has
               seen several Dalit protests of late, the response to the bandh call,
               was tepid, with most establishments and markets remaining open. The
               central government has sent 30 companies of Central Reserve Police
               Force-the country's largest paramilitary force-to various states to
               maintain law and order during the bandh. Home Ministry officials said
               14 of these companies have been sent to Uttar Pradesh, eight to
               Rajasthan, and four each to Madhya Pradesh and Bihar to prevent any
               untoward incident during the bandh called in protest against the
               country's reservation policy. <br><br>
               PATNA: At least 127 people were arrested from different parts of Bihar
               during the nationwide anti-quota bandh on Tuesday. Though security had
               been beefed up by the state government, violence was reported from
               Anand Nagar locality at Ara, 50km west from Patna, where several
               rounds were fired in the air during a clash. ADG of police S K Singhal
               said two groups came face to face at Ara during which the firing took
               place. " Altogether 56 people were arrested in Bhojpur district, 18 in
               Nawada, 24 in Gaya and 29 people were arrested in Darbhanga district,"
               Singhal said, adding the HQ also received reports of road and rail
               blockades from several places. Singhal said Union minister of state
               for HRD Upendra Kushwaha's cavalcade was stopped at Loma in Vaishali
               district while he was on way to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
               programme at Motihari. One company of RAF each had been deployed in
               Patna and East Champaran districts while one company of CPRF each had
               been deployed in Gaya and Muzaffarpur districts to maintain peace
               during the bandh. Two companies of SSB were also deployed - one each
               in Begusarai and Darbhanga districts. <br><br>
               Additional security measures have been taken in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya
               Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand's Haridwar to deter a rerun of the
               violence that hit many cities during the Bharat Bandh call by some
               Dalit groups on April 2 over a Supreme Court order that allegedly
               diluted certain key provisions of the SC/ST Act. Anti-quota groups
               call for Bharat bandh today as the Home Ministry has issued an
               advisory to states to beef up security and prevent violence during the
               Bandh pic. 10:40 AM: Several Policemen have been injured in protests
               during Bharat Bandh today. 10:05 AM: Maximum impact of Bharat Bandh is
               being witnessed in Bihar. 10:00 AM: Bharat Bandh impact in Uttar
               Pradesh - Internet services has been suspended from 6 pm Monday to 6
               pm Tuesday following the order of the District Magistrate in Hapur.
               9:30 AM: Bharat Bandh impact in Bihar: A train in stopped by
               protesters in Bihar's Arrah. 9:00 AM: Reports are coming from Uttar
               Pradresh that there is no impact of Bharat Bandh call seen as yet in
               Meerut. <br>

               <b>Security Council "paralyzed" on new Syria probe amid U.S.-Russia
               discord - Xinhua | English.news.cn</b>
               <p>Photo taken on April 10, 2018 shows the United Nations Security
                  Council voting on a U.S.-draft resolution on probe of chemical
                  weapons use in Syria at the UN headquarters in New York. Russia
                  vetoed a U.S.-drafted Security Council resolution on probe of
                  chemical weapons use in Syria on Tuesday. UNITED NATIONS, April 10 -
                  The United Nationals Security Council remained " Paralyzed " on
                  investigating the recent alleged chemical weapons use in Syria with
                  Russia and the United States continuing to shoot down each other's
                  proposals Tuesday. " Our resolutions are similar, but there are
                  important differences. The key point is our resolution guarantees
                  that any investigations will truly be independent. Russia's
                  resolution gives Russia itself the chance to choose the
                  investigators and then to assess the outcome. There is nothing
                  independent about that," she told the Security Council. " The
                  propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda   propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda  propaganda propaganda propaganda fire will be once again aimed at Russia.... We are using
                  the veto in order to protect the international rule of law, peace
                  and security and to make sure that you do not drag the Security
                  Council into your adventures," he said. Security Council fails to
                  adopt Russian-drafted resolution on OPCW probe of Syria chemical
                  attack. Russia vetoes U.S.-drafted Security Council resolution on
                  probe of chemical weapons use in Syria.
